#' @title Expected per capita loss due to natural mortality
#'
#' @description This function calculates the expected per capita loss, in weight units, due to natural mortality. It is based on the instantaneous mortality rate as predicted by \code{\link{predM}}. Although the concept of per capita loss through mortality only makes sense at the population level, the function output this loss at the individual level.
#'
#' @param M a vector of instantaneous mortality rates, such as outputted by the function \code{\link{predM}}
#' @param Wei a vector of fish sizes, for example, as derived from field data
#' @param Lmeas a vector of fish sizes, for example, as derived from field data. Used only is \code{Wei} is missing.
#' @param a a vector of length-weight parameter 'a's, i.e. the intercept of the Power law. Used only is \code{Wei} is missing.
#' @param b a vector of length-weight parameter 'b's, i.e. the exponent opredMf the Power law. Used only is \code{Wei} is missing.
#' @param t numeric, the number of days through which losses due to mortality should be followed. Defaults to 1 day and considers that \code{M} is scaled to 1 day
#'
#' @return a numeric vector with the per capita expected loss, in weight units, due to natural mortality.

#' @title Applies stochastic natural mortality
#'
#' @description Stochastically draws fate to the individuals, i.e. success = survival, failure = mortality. Uses a Bernoulli distribution to assign fate based on the probability of survival calculated from instantaneous mortality rates (e.g. such as the output of \code{\link{predM}}). Contrarily to \code{\link{somaLoss}} this is easily interpretable at the level of the individual, i.e. survived or not.

#' @param t numeric, the number of days through which losses due to mortality should be followed. Defaults to 1 day and considers that \code{M} is scaled to 1 day
#'
#' @return a logical vector with the fate of the individual (TRUE = survives, FALSE = dies).
