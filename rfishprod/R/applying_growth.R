#' @title Applies VBGF to fish length data
#'
#' @description This function applies the von Bertalanffy Growth Function to fish length data as taken from fish counts, e.g. underwater visual surveys. The von Bertalanffy Growth function describes the growth trajectory of an animal given its population growth parameters, K and Linf. For non-lethally sampled fishes, the only way to ascertain individual age is through body size. This 'operational age' represents the relative likely age of a fish, given its body size. The function first estimates the operational age from field length data and from the growth parameters (K and Linf, which, for the purpose of this package are rescaled to be Kmax and Lmax, see Morais and Bellwood (2018)), and then runs the classic VBGF to determine the length after a period of growing.
#'
#' @param Lmeas a vector of fish lengths, for example, as derived from field data
#' @param t numeric, the number of days through which the growth trajectory of the fishes in the sample should be followed. Defaults to 1 day.
#' @param Lmax a vector of fish maximum species lengths, philosophically analogous to Linf
#' @param Kmax a vector of fish Kmax, philosophically analogous to K. Should be as outputted by the function predKmax 
#' @param t0 a vector with the theoretical size at age 0 for all fish from the data. As discussed before (multiple times, see a review in Morais and Bellwood 2018), has little biological meaning. Often constrained at 0 or using settlement size. For reef fishes it is normally larger than -0.5 (see argument \code{t0lowbound}). If not supplied, calculated using the equation from Pauly (1979).
#' @param t0lowbound lower bound of t0 set as default to -0.5 a (somewhat) arbitrary value that seems to make sense for reef fishes (e.g. see Choat and Robertson 2002).
#' @param silent would you like a function that talks to you? Here it defaults to \code{silent = TRUE}, i.e. no I would not!
#'
#' @return a vector of fish lengths represeting the size of the individuals after growing for a period of \code{t} days

#' @title Expected somatic growth in weight
#'
#' @description This function calculates the expected somatic growth of a fish in weight units. It uses \code{applyVBGF} to apply the von Bertalanffy Growth Function to fish length data and then uses length-weight relationships to estimate the amount of weight that this somatic growth generated. It is the basis for productivity estimates.

#' @param t numeric, the number of days through which the growth trajectory of the fishes in the sample should be followed. Defaults to 1 day.
