\title{A dataset of reef fish growth trajectories}
\format{A data frame with 1921 rows and 19 variables:
\describe{
  \item{Family}{Taxonomic family}
  \item{Species}{Species name}
  \item{SpecCode}{Species code from FishBase}
  \item{MaxSizeTL}{Maximum recorded size for the species, referring to Total Length in cm}
  \item{Diet}{Dietary category, in seven levels, see original dataset}
  \item{Schooling}{Schooling behaviour or gregariousness, in six levels, see original dataset}
  \item{Movimentation}{Position relative to the reef, combining horizontal and vertical components, in six levels, see original dataset}
  \item{a}{Length-weight regression parameter ‘a’, estimated from the Bayesian Hierarchical Model from Froese et al. 2014 and FishBase}
  \item{b}{Length-weight regression parameter ‘b’, estimated from the Bayesian Hierarchical Model from Froese et al. 2014 and FishBase}
  \item{FormFactor}{Body shape factor or Form Factor in Froese 2006, measuring the extent to which a fish is elongated or deep-bodied. It can be perceived as the ‘a’ parameter value a fish species should have if its b = 3}
  \item{LinfTL}{Population asymptotic length in cm, converted to total length if Linf was reported in a measure other than this, see LinfType}
  \item{K}{The Von Bertalanffy Growth coefficient K, as reported by the growth study}
  \item{Kmax}{The standardized growth coefficient Kmax}
  \item{O}{The standardized growth coefficient Ø, also termed Growth Performance Index}
  \item{lon}{Longitudinal geographic coordinate of the population studied}
  \item{lat}{Latitudinal geographic coordinate of the population studied}
  \item{sstmean}{Mean sea surface temperature from the geographic coordinate of the population studied, obtained from Bio-ORACLE}
  \item{pelnpp}{Mean pelagic net primary productivity from the geographic coordinate of the population studied, modelled from chlorophyll concentration and photosynthetic active radiation data}
  \item{Method}{Method used to derive the growth curve, also referred to as the ageing method, in six levels,  see original dataset}

\description{
This dataset was compiled by Morais and Bellwood (2018), and the original can be accessed in the Supporting Information - DS1 of the article with references, locality names and complete names of the categorical traits levels. This is a streamlined version with variables formatted to be used directly within the function \code{\link{predKmax}}. The only change is that the variable "Position" is here renamed as "Movimentation", which is obviously a less adequate name.
