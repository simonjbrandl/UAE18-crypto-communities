\title{Predicts natural mortality rates M for reef fishes}
\usage{
predM(Lmeas, t = 1, Lmax, Kmax, Lr, temp, p = 0.5,
  method = c("Pauly"))
}
\arguments{
\item{Lmeas}{a vector of fish sizes, for example, as derived from field data}

\item{t}{numeric, the number of days through which the growth trajectory of the fishes in the sample should be followed. Defaults to 1 day. In most of the fisheries literature, M is scaled by year instead (i.e. use 365 in that case)}

\item{Lmax}{a vector of fish maximum species lengths, philosophically analogous to Linf}

\item{Kmax}{a vector of fish Kmax, philosophically analogous to K. Should be as outputted by the function \code{\link{predKmax}}}

\item{Lr}{a vector of sizes at settlement. Only relevant for \code{method = 'Function'}}

\item{temp}{a vector of environmental temperatures to which the fish are exposed. Only relevant for \code{method = c('Pauly', 'Function')}}

\item{p}{proportion of the body size range of a species to scale the function to be applied to M at the species-population level. Defaults to 0.5, meaning that M at the individual level is equal to M at the species/population level for fishes in the mid point of their body size range}

\item{method}{method to be used for predicting mortality rates. Can be either \code{'Pauly'}, \code{'Gislason'} or \code{'Function'}. Pauly's equation predicts M at the species/population level from Linf (Lmax here), K (Kmax here) and temperature. Gislason (et al.)'s equation predicts M at the individual-level by incorporating individual size (Lmeas), Lmax and Kmax. The 'Function' method (see Morais and Bellwood, submitted) includes a functional relationship with individual body size to the population-level estimate of M from Pauly. Because there is currently no recommendation on which method should be used for estimating size-specific mortality rates, \code{'Pauly'} is the default, although it should (rather paradoxically) potentially NOT be used.}

\description{
This function uses empirical relationships to predict the likely mortality rates, M, of a fish population or individual (depending on the method, see below). M is the instantaneous mortality rate, the exponent describing the decreasing number of individuals from a cohort through time and, by extension, also describing the cumulative per capita mortality rate of an individual.
