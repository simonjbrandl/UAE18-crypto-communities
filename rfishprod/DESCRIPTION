Description: Implements a framework to generate individual-level estimates
    of fish productivity, with a focus on reef fishes. This individual
    approach works by combining estimates of somatic growth through the
    von Bertalanffy Growth Model, and deterministic or stochastic natural
    mortality using instantaneous mortality rates.
