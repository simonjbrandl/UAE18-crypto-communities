The materials in this folder permit the reproduction of the results presented in Brandl et al. "Energetic demands of extreme temperatures reduce cryptobenthic coral reef fish diversity and functioning." The following elements are provided:
  • UAE18 crypto communities.Rproj: R-project file
  • UAE18_Rscript.Rmd: R-markdown file that contains all code necessary to reproduce the analyses. The script is divided into 11 chunks, that follow the flow of the manuscript:
      1. SETUP
      2. LOAD PACKAGES
      3. LOAD DATASETS AND SET AESTHETICS
      4. TEMPERATURE MAP OF AREA
      5. COMMUNITY STRUCTURE: DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, BIOMASS
      6. COMMUNITY COMPOSITION: FISH AND BENTHOS
      7. PHYSIOLOGY: CTmax and CTmin
      8. DIET METABARCODING: NETWORK ANALYSES
      9. DIET METABARCODING: RAREFACTION
      10. SIZE STRUCTURE AND ABUNDANCES
      11. GROWTH MODELING
      
      Each chunk has subsections pertaining to data wrangling, data analysis, and figures yielded by each analysis. Chunk 4 requires download of the MODIS Aqua temperature data (https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODIS-Aqua/Mapped/Daily/4km/sst) from 2010 to 2018, which can be processed using the auxilliary script provided. Chunk 11 requires the functions provided in the rfishprod package, which is included.
      • Data: Folder that includes all datasets required and produced by the analysis. All data are described in detail in Chunk 3 of the Rmd file.
      • Brandletal_UAE_NEE_AuxilliaryScript.R: Script to process temperature data from the MODIS Aqua database.
      • rfishprod: folder that contains functions accessed during the modeling of growth and mortality in Chunk 11. Created by RA Morais.
